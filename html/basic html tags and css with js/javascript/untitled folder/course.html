       <li><img  src="html.jpg" height=70 weidht=50 alt="html logo"> <b>html</b> 
            <p><u>   HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</u>: is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. 
               With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.
                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a webserver or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages.
                HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. </p>
       </li>
       <li><img src="js.png" height=70 weidht="50" alt="javascript logo"> <b>javascript</b>
           <p><u>JAVASCRIPT </u>: is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language.
                 It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification.
                 Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production.
                The majority of websites employ it and it is supported by all modern Web browsers without plug-ins.
                JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, 
                 supporting object-oriented,imperative, and functional programming styles.</p> 
       </li>
      

        <li><img src="typescript.jpeg" height="70" weidht="50" alt="type script logo"> <b>typescript</b>
             <p><u>type script</u>: is a free and open source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft.
                     It is a strict superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing and class-based object-oriented programming to the language.
                     Anders Hejlsberg, lead architect of C# and creator of Delphi and Turbo Pascal, has worked on the development of TypeScript.
                     TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for client-side or server-side (Node.js) execution</p>

      <li><img src="c.png" height="70" weidht="50" alt="C logo"> <b>C</b>
           <p><u>C </u>: is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, 
             lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. 
             By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, 
              and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems,
              as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.</p>
      </li>
      <li><img src="algol.png" height="70" weidht="50" alt="Algol logo"> <b>Algol</b>
      <p><u>Algol</u>: designated Beta Persei (ß Persei, abbreviated Beta Per, ß Per), known colloquially as the Demon Star, is a bright multiple star in the constellation of Perseus. 
             The first and best known eclipsing binary and also one of the first (non-nova) variable stars to be discovered.
             A three-star system - Beta Persei Aa1, Aa2, and Ab - in which the large and bright primary ß Persei Aa1 is regularly eclipsed by the dimmer ß Persei Aa2. 
            Thus, Algol's magnitude is usually near-constant at 2.1, but regularly dips to 3.4 every 2.86 days (2 days, 20 hours and 49 minutes) during the roughly 10-hour-long partial eclipses. 
            There is also a secondary eclipse (the "second minimum") when the brighter star occults the fainter secondary.
            This secondary eclipse can only be detected photoelectrically.</p>

      <li><img src="pascal.png" height="70" weidht="50" alt="type script logo"> <b>Pascal</b>
                <p><u>Pascal</u>: is an imperative and procedural programming language, which Niklaus Wirth designed in 1968–69 and published in 1970, 
                       as a small, efficient language intended to encourage good programming practices using structured programming and data structuring.
                       A derivative known as Object Pascal designed for object-oriented programming was developed in 1985.</p></li>

      <li><img src="python.png" height="70" weidth="50" alt="python logo"> <b>PYTHON</b>
                 <p><u>PYTHON</u>: is a widely used high-level, general-purpose,interpreted, dynamic programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, 
                                                  and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in language such as C++ or JAVA.
                                                  The language provides constructs intended to anable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.</p>
</li>
      <li><img src="java1.png" height="70" weidth="50" alt="JAVA logo"> <b>JAVA</b>
                 <p><u>JAVA</u>: is general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few 
                                              implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once. run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that
                                              compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode 
                                              that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.

      <li><img src="c_sharp.PNG" height="70" weidth="50" alt="C# logo"> <b>C#</b>
                   <p><u>C#</u>: is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based),
                                            and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334)
                                            and ISO ( ISO/IEC 23270:2006). C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.</p>
